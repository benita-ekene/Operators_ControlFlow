Symbols for Arithmetic Operators include:  +, -, *, /, %, **, ++ and --<br>
2. Assignment Operators<br>
Symbols for Assignment Operators include:  =,  +=,  *=, -=, /=, %=, ^= (bitwise XOR assignment), |= (bitwise OR assignment)<br>
3. Comparison Operators<br>
Symbols for Comparison Operators include: <, >, <=, >=, ==, ===, !==, !===<br>
4. Logical Operators<br>
Symbols for Logical Operators include: &&, //, !<br>
5. Bitwise Operators<br>
Symbols for Bitwise Operators include:<br>
|	(OR) -	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1<br>
^	(XOR) -	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1<br>
~	(NOT) -	Inverts all the bits<br>
<<	(Zero fill left shift) -	Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off<br>

B <h3>For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.</h3>
**Arithmetic Operators**<br>
let y = 2;<br>
let x = 3;<br>
console.log(y+x);<br>
console.log(y-x);<br>
console.log(y*x);<br>
